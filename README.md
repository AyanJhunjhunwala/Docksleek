I finished the bare CLI that should work with most CI/CD systems.

## Next Steps

In the next steps, I plan to:
- Add an automated movement function to reoriganize and redo commands. May o may not be heuristic based.
- Add more detailed logging and error handling.

Not entirely sure what else I can add. Maybe after I finish I can add a quick demo and see if it maybe will help for specific workflows. But in all, happy to get started with Go!
